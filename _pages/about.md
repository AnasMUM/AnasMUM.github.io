My research interests connect aquatic ecology and quantitative ecology, with emphasis on impacts of human pressures on aquatic biota and ecosystem functioning.  This interest stems from my personal history of growing up near a major river in Sri Lanka and my academic training in both aquatic sciences and statistics. During my BSc majoring in Aquaculture and Fisheries, I pursued research on impacts of aquaculture practices on diets of and disease risk in aquatic biota. As I developed a comprehensive understanding of quantitative analyses through my MSc in Biostatistics, I wanted to combine my passion for applied aquatic research with my expertise in statistics. I have been fortunate enough to pursue this interest throughout my Masters, Doctoral, Postdoctoral and other collaborative research.
