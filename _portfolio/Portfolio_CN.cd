We are combining the spatial data on human footprint, climate change velocity, fish assemblage condition and existing protected areas based on a quantitative framework to rank the watersheds for conservation, restoration or species management. We are also identifying networks of hydrologically-connected watersheds that could be prioritized for establishment of protected areas to maximize the benefits for fishes and fish habitats.
